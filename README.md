### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ethan, a computer science student at Dartmouth College in Hanover, NH. I am originally from the D.C. area.

I am interested in programming, music, and gaming. In my studies, I am looking to learn more about machine learning, A.I., and web development.

### Note on Projects

I have privated those repositories that contain school projects so as to adhere to academic policies.
